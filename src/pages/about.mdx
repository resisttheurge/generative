An experiment in space and time.

## Grids

A long-running and poorly-defined project.

### Grids

I've actually re-designed the backend architecture to this one quite a few times over the years, it's interesting! Let me tell you about it.
<Flex
  sx={{
    justifyContent: 'center'
  }}
>
  <Button variant='primary'>Listen intently</Button>
  <Button variant='secondary'>Listen, but don't really pay attention</Button>
  <Button variant='muted'>Walk away</Button>
</Flex>

An important journey.
> Why not me?
- Why not you?
1. Why not all of us?

What I would have said was `() => 'I've been ready'`, but I didn't think it through.

Let's test out some generators!

export const seed = g.seed('Oh no!')

<ul>
  
</ul>

_let me in let me in_

**save me save me Save ME**

_**yiiiiiiikes**_

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
