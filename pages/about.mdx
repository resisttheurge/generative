An experiment in space and time.

## Grids

A long-running and poorly-defined project.

### Grids

I've actually re-designed the backend architecture to this one quite a few times over the years, it's interesting! Let me tell you about it.
<Flex
  sx={{
    justifyContent: 'center'
  }}
>
  <Button variant='primary'>Listen intently</Button>
  <Button variant='secondary'>Listen, but don't really pay attention</Button>
  <Button variant='muted'>Walk away</Button>
</Flex>

- Why not you?
1. Why not all of us?

What I would have said was `() => 'I've been ready'`, but I didn't think it through.

Let's test out some generators!

export const rng = g.rng(g.seed('Oh no!'))

<ul>
  <li>
    {
      g.apply(
        rng,
        g.nat(2)
      )
    }
  </li>
    <li>
    {
      g.apply(
        rng,
        g.nat(2)
      )
    }
  </li>
    <li>
    {
      g.apply(
        rng,
        g.nat(2)
      )
    }
  </li>
    <li>
    {
      g.apply(
        rng,
        g.nat(2)
      )
    }
  </li>
    <li>
    {
      g.apply(
        rng,
        g.nat(2)
      )
    }
  </li>
</ul>
